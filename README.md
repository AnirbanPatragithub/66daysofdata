**66daysofdata**

Starting #66daysofdata challenge,where I will dedicate at least 5 minutes daily to Data Science.  
I will upload all my learning in  github and upload a brief in linkedin.  My github will also serve the purpose of providing a suitable template for those who want to do the same.   
Things I plan to do daily:  
1 . Solve two python questions.  
2  . Solve two SQL Questions.  
3  . Learn one new topic daily either of Deep Learning or Natural Language Processing  
4 . Work on Implementing the learning in a project  
5 . Take Part In Kaggle Competition  
6 .Contribute in any open source project via github    
Disclaimer Alert :   Solving only two python questions will deem the challenge complete for a day.
